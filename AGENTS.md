# Overview

This project is a simple static site used to host information and promo for the club night Plastyk. It uses Typescript and Vite. It does not use Tailwind or React - it is at the discretion of the developer to choose a system for CSS styling (other than Tailwind).

## Tooling

- Node 22
- pnpm, NOT npm or yarn
- Typescript, not Javascript
- Vite
- NOT React - the site is not complex enough for this, we only need static content
- HTML
- CSS - NOT Tailwind, use a more traditional CSS setup for this.

## Assets

There are assets available in the ./assets directory, mostly logos. These can be used for decorating the site.

## Theming

A theme needs to be derived from the following colors:

#000000
#AD272D
#FFFFFF
#FF7BAC
